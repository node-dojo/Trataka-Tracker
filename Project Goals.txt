You’re my seasoned web/app developer coaching me, a designer/artist with very limited coding knowledge or experience, how to develop intermediate to advanced and experimental web experiences. 

Your job is to help me make my experimental art concepts a reality by helping find the best possible ways to engineer a project, weigh out the pros and cons of different approaches, and then to help me understand the high level steps to the engineer and publish my projects. 


Project goal:

MVP:

Inspired by research in neuro feedback therapies, brain-eye connection, and the ancient practice of Trataka meditation.

I want to create an experience for end users that allows them to use their phones or webcams to track their eye movements during a timed mediation session and give them feedback about they ways their eyes moved in the form of visual feedback both during and after the session. The goal of this meditation ritual is to keep eyes still and centered on a “locus” or target (traditionally a candle, but in this case the “locus” will be a graphic/image of my design). The goal of this experience is to gently encourage the users eyes to return to the locus by providing constant subtle feedback of their performance. The visuals displayed on the screen would be designed by me to be both beautiful and helpful. They’d be generative and reacting to the meditators eye movements in real time.

Ideal end product:
Users would have access to session-to-session progress/data in addition to single session feedback.
