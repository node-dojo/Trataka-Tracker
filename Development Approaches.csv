"Approach","Technology","Pros","Cons","Best For"
"1. The Accessible Web Experience","JavaScript using WebGazer.js (eye-tracking) and p5.js (visuals).","Fastest to prototype, most accessible for users (no downloads), great for testing.","Lower tracking accuracy, performance can vary depending on the user's device.","Quickly validating the creative and user experience ideas."
"2. The Native Apple Experience","Swift (programming language) and Apple's ARKit framework for iOS/iPadOS.","Superior performance and accuracy, creates a ""magical"" and polished experience.","High technical complexity, requires a Mac and Apple dev knowledge, exclusive to Apple users.","Building the ideal, high-fidelity version of the project."
"3. The Hybrid App (Cross-Platform)","A framework like React Native or Flutter, with plugins for native features.","Write the code once and deploy to both iOS and Android, reaching a wider audience.","Still very complex and relies on third-party plugins for eye-tracking, which can be a risk.","Reaching the widest possible audience with a single, high-performance app."
