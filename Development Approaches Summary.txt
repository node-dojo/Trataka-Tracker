### Project: Trataka Tracker - Development Approaches Summary

Here is a concise summary of the potential paths for building this project, each with its own pros and cons.

---

#### 1. The Accessible Web Experience

*   **Technology**: JavaScript using libraries like `WebGazer.js` (for webcam eye-tracking) and `p5.js` (for generative visuals).
*   **Pros**: Fastest to prototype, most accessible for users (no downloads), great for testing the core concept.
*   **Cons**: Tracking accuracy is lower and performance can vary.
*   **Best For**: Quickly validating the creative and user experience ideas.

#### 2. The Native Apple Experience (iOS/iPadOS)

*   **Technology**: Swift (programming language) and Apple's `ARKit` framework.
*   **Pros**: Superior performance and accuracy using the iPhone/iPad's advanced sensors. Creates a "magical" and polished user experience.
*   **Cons**: Very high technical complexity, requires a Mac and Apple developer knowledge, and is exclusive to Apple users.
*   **Best For**: Building the ideal, high-fidelity version of the project.

#### 3. The Hybrid App (Cross-Platform)

*   **Technology**: A framework like React Native or Flutter, which uses plugins to access native device features.
*   **Pros**: Write the code once and deploy it to both iOS and Android, reaching a wider audience with a single app.
*   **Cons**: Still very complex and relies on third-party plugins for the core eye-tracking functionality, which can be a risk.
*   **Best For**: Reaching the widest possible audience with a single, high-performance app after the concept has been proven.
